The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable',\n 'infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being',\n 'paid_,â€”what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man',\n 'receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly',\n 'believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no',\n 'account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign',\n 'ourselves to perdition!',\n 'Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome',\n 'exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.

He thinks he breathes it first; but not',\n 'so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many',\n 'other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But',\n 'wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a',\n 'merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling',\n 'voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the',\n 'constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in',\n 'some unaccountable wayâ€”he can better answer than any one else. And,',\n 'doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand',\n 'programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in',\n 'as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive',\n 'performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run',\n 'something like this:',\n 'â€œ_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._',\n 'â€œWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. â€œBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.â€\\x9d',\n 'Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the',\n 'Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when',\n 'others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short',\n 'and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farcesâ€”though I',\n 'cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the',\n 'circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives',\n 'which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced',\n 'me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the',\n 'delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill',\n 'and discriminating judgment.',\n 'Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale',\n 'himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my',\n 'curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island',\n 'bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all',\n 'the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,',\n 'helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things',\n 'would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an',\n 'everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and',\n 'land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to',\n 'perceive a horror, and could still be social with itâ€”would they let',\n 'meâ€”since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of',\n 'the place one lodges in.',\n 'By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the',\n 'great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild',\n 'conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into',\n 'my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them',\n 'all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.',\n 'CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.',\n 'I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my',\n 'arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city',\n 'of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night',\n 'in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little',\n 'packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching',\n 'that place would offer, till the following Monday.',\n 'As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at',\n 'this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well',\n 'be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was',\n 'made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a',\n 'fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous',\n 'old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has',\n 'of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though',\n 'in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket',\n 'was her great originalâ€”the Tyre of this Carthage;â€”the place where the',\n 'first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket',\n 'did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes',\n 'to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did',\n 'that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with',\n 'imported cobblestonesâ€”so goes the storyâ€”to throw at the whales, in',\n 'order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the',\n 'bowsprit?',\n 'Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me',\n 'in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a',\n 'matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a',\n 'very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold',\n 'and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had',\n 'sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,â€”So,',\n 'wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of',\n 'a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the',\n 'north with the darkness towards the southâ€”wherever in your wisdom you',\n 'may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to',\n 'inquire the price, and donâ€™t be too particular.',\n 'With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of â€œThe',\n 'Crossed Harpoonsâ€\\x9dâ€”but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further',\n 'on, from the bright red windows of the â€œSword-Fish Inn,â€\\x9d there came',\n 'such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and',\n 'ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay',\n 'ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,â€”rather weary for me,',\n 'when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from',\n 'hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most',\n 'miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one',\n 'moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of',\n 'the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; donâ€™t',\n 'you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are',\n 'stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets',\n 'that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not',\n 'the cheeriest inns.',\n 'Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,',\n 'and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At',\n 'this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of',\n 'the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light',\n 'proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood',\n 'invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the',\n 'uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble',\n 'over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying',\n 'particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,',\n 'Gomorrah? But â€œThe Crossed Harpoons,â€\\x9d and â€œThe Sword-Fish?â€\\x9dâ€”this, then',\n 'must needs be the sign of â€œThe Trap.â€\\x9d However, I picked myself up and',\n 'hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior',\n 'door.',\n 'It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black',\n 'faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of',\n 'Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the',\n 'preacherâ€™s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping',\n 'and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing',\n 'out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of â€˜The Trap!â€™',\n 'Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the',\n 'docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a',\n 'swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly',\n 'representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words',\n 'underneathâ€”â€œThe Spouter Inn:â€”Peter Coffin.â€\\x9d',\n 'Coffin?â€”Spouter?â€”Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought',\n 'I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this',\n 'Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and',\n 'the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated',\n 'little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here',\n 'from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a',\n 'poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very',\n 'spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.',\n 'It was a queer sort of placeâ€”a gable-ended old house, one side palsied',\n 'as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,',\n 'where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than',\n 'ever it did about poor Paulâ€™s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,',\n 'is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the',\n 'hob quietly toasting for bed. â€œIn judging of that tempestuous wind',\n 'called Euroclydon,â€\\x9d says an old writerâ€”of whose works I possess the',\n 'only copy extantâ€”â€œit maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou',\n 'lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the',\n 'outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where',\n 'the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only',\n 'glazier.â€\\x9d True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my',\n 'mindâ€”old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are',\n 'windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didnâ€™t',\n 'stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint',\n 'here and there. But itâ€™s too late to make any improvements now. The',\n 'universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted',\n 'off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth',\n 'against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with',\n 'his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a',\n 'corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the',\n 'tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken',\n 'wrapperâ€”(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty',\n 'night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their',\n 'oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the',\n 'privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.',\n 'But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up',\n 'to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra',\n 'than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the',\n 'line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in',\n 'order to keep out this frost?',\n 'Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the',\n 'door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be',\n 'moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a',\n 'Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a',\n 'temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.',\n 'But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there',\n 'is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted',\n 'feet, and see what sort of a place this â€œSpouterâ€\\x9d may be.',\n 'CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.',\n 'Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,',\n 'low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of',\n 'the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large',\n 'oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the',\n 'unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent',\n 'study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of',\n 'the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its',\n 'purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first',\n 'you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New',\n 'England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint',\n 'of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and',\n 'especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the',\n 'entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however',\n 'wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.',\n 'But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,',\n 'portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the',\n 'picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a',\n 'nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive',\n 'a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,',\n 'half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to',\n 'it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what',\n 'that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,',\n 'deceptive idea would dart you through.â€”Itâ€™s the Black Sea in a midnight',\n 'gale.â€”Itâ€™s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.â€”Itâ€™s a',\n 'blasted heath.â€”Itâ€™s a Hyperborean winter scene.â€”Itâ€™s the breaking-up of',\n 'the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to',\n 'that one portentous something in the pictureâ€™s midst. _That_ once found',\n 'out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint',\n 'resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?',\n 'In fact, the artistâ€™s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,',\n 'partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with',\n 'whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner',\n 'in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its',\n 'three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,',\n 'purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of',\n 'impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.',\n 'The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish',\n 'array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with',\n 'glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots',\n 'of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping',\n 'round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed',\n 'mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal',\n 'and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,',\n 'horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances',\n 'and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With',\n 'this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan',\n 'Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that',\n 'harpoonâ€”so like a corkscrew nowâ€”was flung in Javan seas, and run away',\n 'with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The',\n 'original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle',\n 'sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last',\n 'was found imbedded in the hump.',\n 'Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched wayâ€”cut',\n 'through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with',\n 'fireplaces all roundâ€”you enter the public room. A still duskier place',\n 'is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled',\n 'planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craftâ€™s',\n 'cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored',\n 'old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like',\n 'table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities',\n 'gathered from this wide worldâ€™s remotest nooks. Projecting from the',\n 'further angle of the room stands a dark-looking denâ€”the barâ€”a rude',\n 'attempt at a right whaleâ€™s head. Be that how it may, there stands the',\n 'vast arched bone of the whaleâ€™s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost',\n 'drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old',\n 'decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,',\n 'like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),',\n 'bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells',\n 'the sailors deliriums and death.',\n 'Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true',\n 'cylinders withoutâ€”within, the villanous green goggling glasses',\n 'deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians',\n 'rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpadsâ€™ goblets. Fill to',\n '_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;',\n 'and so on to the full glassâ€”the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp',\n 'down for a shilling.',\n 'Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about',\n 'a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I',\n 'sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with',\n 'a room, received for answer that his house was fullâ€”not a bed',\n 'unoccupied. â€œBut avast,â€\\x9d he added, tapping his forehead, â€œyou haint no',\n 'objections to sharing a harpooneerâ€™s blanket, have ye? I sâ€™pose you are',\n 'goinâ€™ a-whalinâ€™, so youâ€™d better get used to that sort of thing.â€\\x9d',\n 'I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should',\n 'ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that',\n 'if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the',\n 'harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander',\n 'further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with',\n 'the half of any decent manâ€™s blanket.',\n 'â€œI thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?â€”you want supper?',\n 'Supperâ€™ll be ready directly.â€\\x9d',\n 'I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the',\n 'Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with',\n 'his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space',\n 'between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but',\n 'he didnâ€™t make much headway, I thought.',\n 'At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an',\n 'adjoining room. It was cold as Icelandâ€”no fire at allâ€”the landlord said',\n 'he couldnâ€™t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a',\n 'winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold',\n 'to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the',\n 'fare was of the most substantial kindâ€”not only meat and potatoes, but',\n 'dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a',\n 'green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful',\n 'manner.',\n 'â€œMy boy,â€\\x9d said the landlord, â€œyouâ€™ll have the nightmare to a dead',\n 'sartainty.â€\\x9d',\n 'â€œLandlord,â€\\x9d I whispered, â€œthat aint the harpooneer is it?â€\\x9d',\n 'â€œOh, no,â€\\x9d said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, â€œthe',\n 'harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he',\n 'donâ€™tâ€”he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes â€™em rare.â€\\x9d',\n 'â€œThe devil he does,â€\\x9d says I. â€œWhere is that harpooneer? Is he here?â€\\x9d',\n 'â€œHeâ€™ll be here afore long,â€\\x9d was the answer.',\n 'I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this â€œdark',\n 'complexionedâ€\\x9d harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so',\n 'turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into',\n 'bed before I did.',\n 'Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not',\n 'what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the',\n 'evening as a looker on.',\n 'Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord',\n 'cried, â€œThatâ€™s the Grampusâ€™s crew. I seed her reported in the offing',\n 'this morning; a three yearsâ€™ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now',\n 'weâ€™ll have the latest news from the Feegees.â€\\x9d',\n 'A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung',\n 'open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their',\n 'shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,',\n 'all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they',\n 'seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from',\n 'their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,',\n 'that they made a straight wake for the whaleâ€™s mouthâ€”the barâ€”when the',\n 'wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out',\n 'brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon',\n 'which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he',\n 'swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never',\n 'mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,',\n 'or on the weather side of an ice-island.',\n 'The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even',\n 'with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began',\n 'capering about most obstreperously.',\n 'I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though',\n 'he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his',\n 'own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much',\n 'noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the',\n 'sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though',\n 'but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I',\n 'will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six',\n 'feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I',\n 'have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and',\n 'burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the',\n 'deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem',\n 'to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a',\n 'Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of',\n 'those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When',\n 'the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man',\n 'slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my',\n 'comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his',\n 'shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with',\n 'them, they raised a cry of â€œBulkington! Bulkington! whereâ€™s',\n 'Bulkington?â€\\x9d and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.',\n 'It was now about nine oâ€™clock, and the room seeming almost',\n 'supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself',\n 'upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the',\n 'entrance of the seamen.',\n 'No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal',\n 'rather not sleep with your own brother. I donâ€™t know how it is, but',\n 'people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to',\n 'sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,',\n 'and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely',\n 'multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should',\n 'sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep',\n 'two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all',\n 'sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and',\n ...]"
